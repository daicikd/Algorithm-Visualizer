<h1>Algorithm Visualizer</h1>

<p>

The Algorithm Visualizer is a simple web-based tool built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that helps users see how sorting algorithms work step-by-step. The project visually represents algorithms like Bubble Sort and Selection Sort by displaying bars of different heights that move and rearrange as they are sorted. 

- HTML provides the structure of the page, such as buttons and containers.
- CSS styles the bars, buttons, and layout, making the visualizer look neat and engaging.
- JavaScript controls the sorting animations, showing each step of the algorithm in real time.

This tool is designed to make learning algorithms more interactive and fun by letting users watch how data is organized by different sorting methods.
